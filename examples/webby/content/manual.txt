Webby is an application written using the Ruby programming language. You will need to install a Ruby interpreter on your computer. Download and installation instructions can be found on the "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org webiste. For the Windows platform, the one-click installer is recommended. Webby is not compatible with the Ruby 1.9.0 release; please use the Ruby 1.8.6 release.

You will also need to install RubyGems. If you used the Windows one-click installer, RubyGems is already present on your system. For everyone else you can find installation instructions on the "RubyGems":http://rubygems.org/read/chapter/3 website.

To install Webby and its dependent gems type the following command. Omit the @sudo@ portion for the Windows platform; you will need to specify the *mswin32* versions of the _mongrel_ and _hpricot_ dependent gems when prompted.

<pre class="code">
sudo gem install -y webby
</pre>

To make use of all the features Webby has to offer, the following gems should also be installed. These gems provide different ways to transform text into HTML or CSS.

<pre class="code">
sudo gem install -y RedcCoth
sudo gem install -y BlueCloth
sudo gem install -y haml
sudo gem install -y coderay
</pre>
